How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It shows me the lines with diffrences and it is easyer to find the typos and other errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can revert to previous versions or track the changes easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros:
- can group modifications when resolved a certain task
- can track the changes focusing on tasks
Cons:
- some changes might be lost if some technical problems occur

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is focusing on grouping file modifications by a certain task (changes can be dependant), Google Docs for example is for editing one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- git log lists all the commits in current repository with the commit id and info
- git diff shows the modification in a given commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I can revert to a previous version anytime so I can modify the files freely.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
